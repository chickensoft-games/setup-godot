inputs:
  version:
    description: >-
      Godot 4 version: e.g., 4.0.0-beta1, 4.0.0-beta.16, 4.0.0, etc. Must include major, minor, and patch (additional pre-release label is optional). Specify `global` or `global.json` to use the version from the project's global.json file.

      ```yaml
      - uses: Mimyr-Games-LTD/setup-godot-custom@v1
        with:
          version: global
      ```

      In the root of your project, include a global.json file:

      ```json
      {
        "sdk": {
          "version": "6.0.406",
          "rollForward": "latestMinor"
        },
        "msbuild-sdks": {
          "Godot.NET.Sdk": "4.0.0"
        }
      }
      ```

      **Important:** If using a global.json file in your project, do *not* specify the version of the Godot.NET.Sdk in your project's `*.csproj` file.

      ```xml
      <Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk"> <!-- GOOD -->
      <Project Sdk="Godot.NET.Sdk/4.0.0"> <!-- BAD -->
      ```
