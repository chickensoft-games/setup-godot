## Project Setup

It's our goal to keep this action up-to-date and working to install .NET-enabled versions of Godot directly on each GitHub Actions runner OS. If you spot a bug, please feel free to open an issue â€” or a pull request!

## Releases

We're using [Tag/Release on Push][tag-release-on-push] to ensure releases occur whenever main is updated, unless you include `[norelease]` in the commit title or add a `norelease` label. See the action's documentation for more details about automatic Github Actions releases.
